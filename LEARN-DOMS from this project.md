** Differences in import apostrophes:

- "" is used for importing modules
- '' is used for importing files
- `` is used for importing files with variables

Potential issues: Can cause 401 if not variable is included rightly
-------------------------------------------------

** Structure - and general architecture and dividing the code down in smaller manageable catgories is super-nice and good, and also needed
- Just look at the general Components folder with subfolders, and how everything is divided down right there. And the Routes folder how easy it is
    to understand the child relationship. Super easy how the app starts, and then divides down into several sub-relationships related on those
    simple pieces of code.

-------------------------------------------------

** Dtos arent that bad. Actually.
- Ok i have to admit. Theyre actually quite good and come quite in handy when choosing what data to pass over the endpoint.

-------------------------------------------------

** TailwindCss is nice
- Feel the easiness of it seems nice. Just have to understand it a bit more.

-------------------------------------------------

** Toastify, is super-nice! The thing that makes Popup-AutomaticallyDisappearing-Notification-Windows-WithCountDownBar
- If used correctly in App.tsx and imported, one can use it in many different forms in the application, like "toast.success" etc.
= Supernice and im actually quite in awe.
